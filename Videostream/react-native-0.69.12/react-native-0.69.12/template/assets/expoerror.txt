The error indicates that there is no development build of your
 Expo project installed on the Android emulator. 
 This typically happens when you haven't built and 
 installed the Expo Go app on your emulator or device.

Here are the steps to resolve the issue:

Build and Install Development Build:

Ensure that your Android emulator is running.

Open a new terminal window, navigate to your project directory,
 and run the following command to build and install the development build on the emulator:

bash
Copy code
expo build:android -t apk
This command will build the Android APK file for your Expo project. 
Once the build is complete, Expo CLI will provide a link to download the APK. 
Download and install the APK on your emulator.

Restart Expo Development Server:

After installing the development build on the emulator,
 restart the Expo development server 
 by stopping it with Ctrl+C in the terminal 
 where it's running and then running npm start again.
Run Expo Go App:

Open Expo Go on your emulator,
 and you should see your project listed. If not,
  scan the QR code provided in the Expo CLI output.
Check Expo Go Version:

Ensure that you are using a compatible version of Expo Go.
 Sometimes, using an outdated Expo Go version 
 can cause compatibility issues. Update Expo Go on your emulator if needed.
After completing these steps, your development 
build should be installed on the Android emulator,
 and you should be able to open and run your Expo project.
  If you encounter any issues, double-check 
  the Expo documentation for the latest instructions and troubleshooting tips.
