It appears that the eas command is not recognized, 
indicating that the Expo Application Services (EAS) CLI is not installed 
or not available in your system's PATH.

Let's try to resolve this:

Install EAS CLI:
Install the EAS CLI globally by running the following command:

bash
Copy code
npm install -g eas-cli
This command installs the EAS CLI globally on your machine.

Verify Installation:
After installation, verify that the eas command is recognized by running:

bash
Copy code
eas --version
Ensure that there are no errors, and it displays the version of the EAS CLI.

Restart Terminal:
If you installed the EAS CLI while the terminal was open, 
restart the terminal to make sure the changes take effect.

Check System's PATH:
Double-check that the directory where npm installs 
global packages is included in your system's PATH. 
The directory is usually something like C:\Users\YourUsername\AppData\Roaming\npm on Windows.
 On macOS/Linux, it's typically /usr/local/bin or another location.

Use npx as a Temporary Solution:
If you encounter issues with the
global EAS CLI, you can use npx as a temporary solution. For example:

bash
Copy code
npx eas login
This will use the locally installed EAS CLI without relying on the globally installed version.

After completing these steps, you should be able to use the eas command without any issues.
 If you continue to face problems, ensure that the installation path of the 
 global npm packages is included in your system's PATH. If the issue persists, there might 
be an issue with the npm configuration or the environment variables.
