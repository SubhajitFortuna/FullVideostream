npx expo build:android

  $ expo build:android is not supported in the local CLI, please use eas build -p android instead
ChatGPT
It seems like there have been changes in the Expo CLI, and 
they are now encouraging users to use the Expo Application Services 
(EAS) Build for building Android and iOS apps. The error message is 
suggesting that you use eas build instead of expo build:android.

Here's how you can proceed:

Install EAS CLI:
If you haven't already, you need to install the EAS CLI. Run the following 
command to install it globally:

bash
Copy code
npm install -g eas-cli
Authenticate with EAS:
Authenticate with EAS by running the following command and following the prompts:

bash
Copy code
eas login
This will prompt you to log in to your Expo account.

Initiate EAS Build:
Instead of using expo build:android, use the following command with EAS:

bash
Copy code
eas build --platform android
This command initiates the EAS build for Android.

Follow On-Screen Instructions:
EAS will guide you through the build process.
 Follow the on-screen instructions,
  and it may ask for additional information or configurations depending on your project.

Check Build Status:
You can check the status of your build using:

bash
Copy code
eas build --status
This will provide information about the status of your build,
 and once it's complete,
it will provide a link to download the built artifacts.

Using EAS Build is recommended by
 Expo for improved performance and more control 
 over the build process. If you encounter any issues or need more information, 
 you can refer to the official EAS documentation:
  Expo Application Services (EAS) - Build.
